		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<img src="portrait.png">
		<p>Musician, songwriter, outdoor enthusiast, motorcyclist, beginning web developer, beer aficionado, coffee drinker. These are some of the things that could describe me. I'm passionate about life, and love learning new things. I've always loved the world where technology and art intersect. This has been the case my entire life. From creating things with Legos as a kid, to woodworking, to recording music. It's in this world that I find my greatest joy.</p>
		<p>In June of this year, I began teaching myself to code. I have many friends who are developers, and for some reason never dabbled with it until recently. I thought you had to be a computer science or math nerd. While I'm definitely a nerd, I don't fall into either of those categories. I began with an entry level HTML and CSS tutorial on codeacademy.com. I loved it! I continued to learn via tutorials and other online resources, until finally registering and hosting a domain name so I could have a little playground to experiment with what I was learning. I experimented with a Ruby tutorial for a little while, but realized that I wanted to animate some things on my site, so JavaScript and jQuery were the next step. I have spent hours reading and taking tutorials on JavaScript, and love every second of it. While creating this page, I decided to try out some jQuery stuff. Through some trial and error, Googling and YouTube videos, I figured out how to get my page to respond how I wanted. </p>
		<p>I'm very excited about becoming a web developer. At this point, I have spent countless hours on tutorials, reading and coding, and I can't get enough. I've spent a lot of time talking with friends who are developers, and I am certain that this career is what I want to pursue. I feel like it's what I've been looking to do my whole life, and am just now discovering it at 29. </p>
